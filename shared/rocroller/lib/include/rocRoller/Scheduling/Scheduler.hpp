         * Locking Rules
         *
         * A scheduler has a number of streams which each will yield a sequence of instructions.
         * The job of the scheduler is to pick (i.e. schedule) the instruction from the beginning 
	 * of one of the streams, and then repeat until there are no more streams with any 
	 * instructions left.
         *
         * - If a scheduler schedules a lock for a non-preemptible dependency, 
	 *   it must continue to select instructions from that same stream 
	 *   until that lock has been unlocked.
         * - That stream might include further lock/unlock instructions which
         *   must occur in a last-in, first-out order, those should be treated
         *   as a stack to track when the original lock has been unlocked.
	 *
	 * - Dependency rank (low-to-high):
	 *   Branch (Non-preemptible)
	 *   M0 (Preemptible)
	 *   VCC (Preemptible)
	 *   SCC (Non-preemptible)
         *
         * - If a stream yields any kind of lock, it cannot yield a lower-ranked
         *   dependency lock until it releases the higher-ranked dependency lock.
         * - If a scheduler schedules a lock for a preemptible dependency,
	 *   it cannot schedule the same kind of lock from any other stream 
	 *   until that lock is released.
         *      Example:
         *          1. Stream 0 locks M0.
         *          2. Stream 1 locks VCC.
         *          3. Stream 0 tries to lock VCC.  It must wait until Stream 1 unlocks VCC.
         *          4. Stream 1 unlocks VCC.
         *          5. Stream 0 locks VCC.
         *          6. Stream 1 locks SCC.  Pull from Stream 1 until SCC is unlocked.
         *          7. Stream 0 locks SCC.  Pull from Stream 0 until SCC is unlocked.
         *          8. Stream 0 unlocks VCC.
         *          9. Stream 0 unlocks M0.
         *
         * - If a scheduler schedules a lock for a preemptible dependency, 
	 *   it cannot schedule a lower-ranked non-preemptible dependency lock 
	 *   from any stream until that lock is released.
         *      Examples:
         *          - If stream 0 locks M0, and then we see stream 3 try to lock
         *            Branch, we can't pull from stream 3 until stream 0
         *            releases M0.
         *          - If stream 2 locks VCC, stream 1 can lock SCC.  We will
         *            then have to pull from stream 1 until SCC is released.
